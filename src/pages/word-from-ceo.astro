				At Canary, we utilize cutting-edge technology to decode genomics and support clinical
				decision-making with unprecedented accuracy. Our dedicated team has pioneered the
				development of a remarkably comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) test and smaller focused
				panels which are meticulously validated for absolute sensitivity and specificity and held to
				the highest standards, as demonstrated by our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
				(CLIA) certification and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation. We also
				provide extraordinarily useful ctDNA tests.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-2 text-gray-700">
				Our CGP test analyzes 1091 genes associated with cancer and also tests for drug
				sensitivities, providing oncologists and patients with crucial insights into personalized
				treatment strategies. Beyond the laboratory, our team is committed to providing personalized
				support throughout the entire diagnostic journey. We offer direct assistance to physicians
				in interpreting complex genomic reports, ensuring that treatment decisions are based on the
				latest scientific evidence and tailored to each patientâ€™s unique genetic profile.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-gray-700">
				At the heart of everything we do is a profound commitment to improving patient outcomes and
				enhancing quality of life. We understand the significant impact of a cancer diagnosis on
				individuals and their loved ones. Therefore, alongside our rigorous focus on the accuracy
				and reliability of our tests, our team extends guidance and support to the families of
				patients, helping them navigate the complexities of cancer treatment and genetic information
				with empathy and clarity.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-gray-700">
				At Canary, we are not just advancing genomic medicine; we are redefining it to empower
				patients, physicians, and families with the knowledge and support they need to make informed
				decisions and achieve better outcomes in the fight against cancer.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-gray-700">
				We are proud of the quality of our tests and are delighted that the oncology community
				recognizes its power and utility.
			</p>

			<p class="text-gray-700">
				Thank you for trusting us with the molecular diagnosis you and your family deserve.
